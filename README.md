# Title: Directory Backup
### This is a simple shell script that automates the process of creating a backup of a directory

## How to use:
1. To use this script, save it as a text file with a .sh extension (e.g. backup_script.sh). 
2. Then, navigate to the directory where the script is saved and run the following command in your terminal:bash backup_script.sh
3. This will execute the script and create a compressed backup file of the specified directory. You can modify the DIR_TO_BACKUP and BACKUP_FILE_NAME variables to fit your needs. Additionally, you can add more commands to the script to further automate the backup process, such as copying the backup file to a remote server or scheduling the backup to run at specific intervals using a tool like cron.

## Purpose:
I wanted to practice using shell scripting that would automate something useful in my life and it was fun to learn.
