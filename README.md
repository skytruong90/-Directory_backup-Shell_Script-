# Title: Directory Backup
### This is a simple shell script that automates the process of creating a backup of a directory

## How to use:
1. To use this script, save it as a text file with a .sh extension (e.g. backup_script.sh). 
2. Then, navigate to the directory where the script is saved and run the following command in your terminal:bash backup_script.sh
3. This will execute the script and create a compressed backup file of the specified directory. You can modify the DIR_TO_BACKUP and BACKUP_FILE_NAME variables to fit your needs. Additionally, you can add more commands to the script to further automate the backup process, such as copying the backup file to a remote server or scheduling the backup to run at specific intervals using a tool like cron.

## Purpose:
I wanted to practice using shell scripting that would automate something useful in my life and it was fun way to learn shell scripting.

## What is shell script?
A shell script is a script written in a shell programming language that runs on a command-line interface (CLI) or terminal. A shell is a program that acts as an intermediary between a user and the operating system, allowing users to interact with the operating system through a command-line interface.

Shell scripts are written to automate tasks and processes that would otherwise need to be manually performed by a user. Shell scripts can be used to perform a wide variety of tasks, such as system administration, file management, and data processing. They can also be used to create more complex scripts that combine multiple commands and operations.

Some common shell scripting languages include Bash (Bourne-Again SHell), Zsh (Z shell), Ksh (Korn shell), and Fish (Friendly Interactive SHell). These shells provide a range of programming features, such as variables, loops, and functions, to allow users to write more complex and powerful scripts.

Shell scripts can be executed in a terminal by running the script file, or by invoking the shell and passing the script as a command-line argument. Additionally, shell scripts can be scheduled to run automatically using a tool like cron.

## Shell script vs Bash script
The main difference between shell scripts and Bash scripts is that shell scripts can be written in any shell programming language, while Bash scripts are specific to the Bash programming language. Bash scripts can take advantage of the specific features and syntax of the Bash programming language, which may differ from other shell programming languages. For example, Bash has a number of features and built-in commands that are not available in other shell languages.

In summary, shell scripts are a more general category of scripts that can be written in various shell programming languages, while Bash scripts are shell scripts written specifically in the Bash programming language.
